After getting a planer I decided to resurface the [first desk](/2016/06/10/desk-build-01) I build so that it could be used for writing without a glass cover.

I ripped the table apart down the glue lines from its original construction with a circular saw.

I thought it would be easier and safer to use a circular saw than trying to push a big uneven table top through the table saw. Although after a couple rips with the circular saw to remove some weight and size it would have probably been easier on the table.

The original top laid out ready to be planed.

This is the second planer I got after the [first one](/2017/04/17/building-a-workbench) broke, was replaced and then the replacement broke again. It is the same design but from a different manufacturer and appears to be made of tougher stuff.

I decided to rebuild the frame for this table too for the same reason as the [second desk](/2016/06/28/desk-build-02), the table was awkward to use with chair armrests.

I glued up the table top the same was as before with dowels and clamps.

After the planing so many of the knots fell out of the wood. Here they have been filled up with clear resin. I think it would have looked better with some black dye in them as they dried with a very slight yellow tint.

After a lot of sanding to remove the extra resin the table was varnished again and came out very smooth and flat, no need for the glass anymore.
