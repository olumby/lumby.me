I would like a trial by combat. What is dead may never die. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. All men must die. You know nothing, Jon Snow. 

Pay the iron price. All men must die. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. And now his watch is ended. All men must die. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. You know nothing, Jon Snow. More pigeon pie, please. All men must die. As High as Honor. As High as Honor. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. 

Lucky for the ladies. All men must die. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.
