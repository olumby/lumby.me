                <p>This TV table is to sit outside on a covered terrace. It needs to be high enough to been seen over chairs and thin enough to not get in the way.</p>
<p>I started off by building a simple box and splitting it in two to give me two boxes. I then created 5 panels for the 2 shelves, 2 sides and table top.</p>

<p>I am using reclaimed wood for the project and most of it is left overs from previous projects. Due to this one of the panels had to be joined with lots of small pieces (second in the photo) and had very little strength. But this will be the bottom shelf and will be supported by the box on all sides.</p>

<p>I join the legs to the two boxes with glue and dowels.</p>

<p>The panels are lent against the table or held by clamps to preview how it will look. It was at this point I realised I needed the two front pieces to cover the gap between legs and side panels.</p>

<p>The completed table after sanding and varnishing, the wheels are added to the bottom and the middle shelf is held in by screws so it can be removed or relocated.</p>

<p>Here the finished table is on the terrace with the TV. You can see why the table's height was important so the view is not blocked by the opposite chairs.</p>
