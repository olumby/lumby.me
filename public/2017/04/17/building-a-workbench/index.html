                <p>I built this work bench quickly for a previous project, but with cheap wood and a bad design it did not last long before it became wobbly and needed replacing.</p>

<p>After using a small workbench and the floor it was time to build a real workbench. One that would also integrate my table saw and provide storage for other tools.</p>
<p>I didn't take many photos of this project unfortunately as I wanted to build it quick to work on another project.</p>
<p>The wood for this project was reclaimed wood that had been roughly planed already. I also bought heavy duty industrial wheels as the salvaged IKEA ones on my previous bench broke.</p>
<p>I re-planed the wood to make it perfectly square and smooth.</p>

<p>I wanted an MDF top for the bench but it was sold out so I settled with chipboard for now. The table saw is also only sat on wooden supports eventually this will be replaced with chipboard and have adjustment screws to keep it level with the rest of the bench.</p>
<p>The bench was joint together using lap joints and is very sturdy.</p>

<p>I attached the other two pieces of chipboard to go along side the table saw and bolted on the wheels.</p>
<p>I build a smaller bench that just sits off the end to hold the planer at a better height.</p>

<p>Here the bench is packed away and filled with tools, the smaller bench tucks tidily under the table saw and the planer fits behind it.</p>

<p>Here it is neatly tucked into the garage.</p>
