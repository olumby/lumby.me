                <p>After getting a planer I decided to resurface the <a href="/2016/06/10/desk-build-01">first desk</a> I build so that it could be used for writing without a glass cover.</p>
<p>I ripped the table apart down the glue lines from its original construction with a circular saw. </p>

<p>I thought it would be easier and safer to use a circular saw than trying to push a big uneven table top through the table saw. Although after a couple rips with the circular saw to remove some weight and size it would have probably been easier on the table.</p>

<p>The original top laid out ready to be planed.</p>

<p>This is the second planer I got after the <a href="/2017/04/17/building-a-workbench">first one</a> broke, was replaced and then the replacement broke again. It is the same design but from a different manufacturer and appears to be made of tougher stuff.</p>

<p>I decided to rebuild the frame for this table too for the same reason as the <a href="/2016/06/28/desk-build-02">second desk</a>, the table was awkward to use with chair armrests.</p>

<p>I glued up the table top the same was as before with dowels and clamps.</p>

<p>After the planing so many of the knots fell out of the wood. Here they have been filled up with clear resin. I think it would have looked better with some black dye in them as they dried with a very slight yellow tint.</p>
<p><img src="/images/desk-resurface/P1010491.jpg" alt="image" title="image" /></p>
<p>After a lot of sanding to remove the extra resin the table was varnished again and came out very smooth and flat, no need for the glass anymore.</p>
